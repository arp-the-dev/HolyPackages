<h1 align="center"> HolyPackage  </h1>

<p>Adds a rare package for each holycube member, that's it !</p>
<p>This mod is a custom mod made for the modpack Holcyube Revolution.</p>
<p>I let you discover all rare package variants by yourself. Added the 51 members of the current season plus 3 other rare packages including the HC package below.</p>
<p>If you dislike the texture or the id of a package, please open an issue on github with the label "request changes".</p>
<p>The code was made by Igl&eacute;e42 and Arp_sys.</p>
<p>The textures was made by Arp_sys.</p>
<p>Original idea by The_Smitties.</p>
<p>Thanks Igl&eacute;e42 for the help.</p>
<p>Feel free to reuse the source code in order to make your own rare custom packages.</p>
